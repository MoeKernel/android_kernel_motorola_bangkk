      - Enable this option will automatically re-order the mount id and parent mount id in /proc/self/mountinfo as much as it can according to the list of sus_mount.
      - Only mount paths added to sus_mount will be counted, because we are not able to get the mount id of sus mounts umounted by user during enumerating the current mount list.
      - Also be careful this feature may cause unknown system crashes/random reboot/bootloop, further testing is needed on other kernels and devices.
      - Required KSU_SUSFS_SUS_MOUNT to be ON
